# IntroToMLProject
This contains the final research-track project I completed as part of the requirements of the Introduction to ML course under Prof Fraida Fund. As part of this project, we selected a piece of recently published work in machine learning and studied it by:
•	learning about the work described in the paper,
•	examining the claim(s) made in the paper and how they are validated,
•	and then running some existing version of it.

I chose DeepMind's paper on AlphaFold2, "Highly accurate protein structure prediction with AlphaFold", published in Nature in 2021. It describes the working, testing and results behind the computational method that was able to achieve previously unprecedented accuracy levels in the biennial protein structure prediction experiment called Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction in 2020. Simplistically, it was the first model that could figure out the structure of a protein with atomic accuracy. 

I truly enjoyed studying for this project because these kinds of interdisciplinary applications of ML that have the potential to take us closer to solving wide-ranging human problems are what excite me the most. Would love to explore this further if I get the opportunity.
